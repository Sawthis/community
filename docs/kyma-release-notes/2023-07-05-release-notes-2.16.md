 
## Telemetry
- We have moved Loki LogPipeline of the logging component to the telemetry module so that it gets installed if the logging component is available, but the component will not fail in the absence of the telemetry module. For more information, see the [PR](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/issues/17549).
- The following components have been updated:
  - [OTel-collector to version 0.79.0](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/pull/17629)
  - [Fluent Bit to version 2.1.4](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/pull/17658)
- We have improved the [custom Loki example](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/pull/243).
- We have introduced support for multiple TracePipelines.
- To improve availability, we have added a second replica of `telemetry-trace-collector`.

## Serverless
### Deprecation of Node.js 16 Serverless runtime
Because of the [scheduled EOL for Node.js 16](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule), we plan to remove Node.js 16 from the list of supported runtimes.

For now, we recommend that you donâ€™t use Node.js 16 as a runtime for your new Functions and re-configure all your existing Node.js 16 Functions to run on the latest available Node.js runtime.

Read this [blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/03/09/changing-the-function-runtime-version-of-a-running-function/) to learn how to update existing Functions.

### Node.js 14 runtime removed
Node.js 14 has reached the end of its life. Therefore, followed by the depreciation of Node.js 14 Serverless runtime, we decided to finally remove it from the list of the available Function runtimes.

Your Node.js 14 Functions' workloads will continue to run, but you will not be able to edit them without changing the `runtime` field. Sooner or later, you must change the **spec** of your existing Node.js 14-based Functions and change the `runtime` field to either `nodejs16` or `nodejs18`.

For more information about the Node.js 14 deprecation, see the [Kyma 2.12 release notes](https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma/releases/tag/2.12.0).
